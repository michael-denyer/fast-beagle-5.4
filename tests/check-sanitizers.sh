# Builds build/beagle and the BGEN unit tests under AddressSanitizer and
# UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, in build/san so the normal build is untouched,
# then runs every oracle case as VCF only, with bgen=plink2 and with
# bgen=phased. Every run must exit 0 with the oracle hash and no sanitizer
# report. On Linux LeakSanitizer also runs; it does not support macOS arm64.
# On macOS it then builds build/beagle under ThreadSanitizer in build/tsan and
# runs every oracle case at 18 threads, and the thread-dependent cases again
# with trace= (parallel_for workers write trace seams). ThreadSanitizer cannot
# start in the gate's docker leg: it needs an address layout that the x86_64
# emulation gives only with ASLR off, and docker forbids turning ASLR off.
# Output refusal checks also run with leak detection off: util_exit leaves
# memory allocated by design.
#
# Usage: tests/check-sanitizers.sh
# NTHREADS overrides the thread counts tried (default "1 2").
# CASES restricts the run to the named cases (default all).
